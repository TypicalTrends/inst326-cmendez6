So I was using Ai this week to find some headlight parts for my car. I haven't been using
AI a lot lately. What I did was try to compare parts and find lights that were affortable
and worked. I found Claude and chatgpt to be very useful in my search. I just wished they would 
provide links since I had to search them manually. I hope to use it this week for 
assignments since I find it to be super useful, but also be time effective.
