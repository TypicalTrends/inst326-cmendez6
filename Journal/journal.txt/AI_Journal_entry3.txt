So for this week I used AI in some of my SQL assignments from a course. I was confused about a section of my query, so 
I decided to use claude for suggestions. I find claude to be extremely useful when it comes to uploading photos. chatgpt
in my experience does not provide a satisfying response even with all the photos submitted. chatgpt takes too long to process
photos, maybe its just me but with claude I get more. Another thing is that claude gives multiple suggestions for an answer.
I find this useful since it not vague and it remains simple. In the end I found what I was looking for. I think that using
AI has saved me time with problems like these.
