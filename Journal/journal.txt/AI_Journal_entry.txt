Week 1
I have used AI for basic tasks such as asking quesitons. I have started to use claude and so far
I haven't had any complains with it so far. I asked it for some ideas for how to response to a discussion 
for one of my class here is the link: https://claude.ai/share/7fa00960-195c-4e26-a71a-bbe6725d8e1a 
I think that is has been very helpful into what I wanted to get out of it. I think it works a lot better than
chatgpt or others. It was a lot more accurate and was very quick in the response. I worked more as a second
thinking partner. 

I haven't tired it coding yet, but I did try it for sql stuff and it was a lot less accurate than what I expected
I think it needs more work with that or I just was not detailed as I needed to be. I think it's an issue on my end 
since I wasn't understanding the problem myself enough.
