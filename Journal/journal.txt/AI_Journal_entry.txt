Week 1

I have used AI for basic tasks such as asking quesitons. I have started to use claude and so far
I haven't had any complains with it so far. I asked it for some ideas for how to create a response to a discussion 
for one of my class here is the link: https://claude.ai/share/7fa00960-195c-4e26-a71a-bbe6725d8e1a 
It has been very helpful and very informative to what I wanted as being a good reply. I think it works a lot better than
chatgpt or others. It was a lot more accurate and was very quick in generating. I works more as a second
thinking partner. 

I haven't tired it for coding yet, but I did try it for sql stuff and it was a lot less accurate than what I expected.
I think it needs more work with that or I just was not detailed enough as I needed to be. I think it's an issue on my end 
since I wasn't understanding the problem myself enough.

So I was using Ai this week to find some headlight parts for my car. I haven't been using
AI a lot lately. What I did was try to compare parts and find lights that were affortable
and worked. I found Claude and chatgpt to be very useful in my search. I just wished they would 
provide links since I had to search them manually. I hope to use it this week for 
assignments since I find it to be super useful, but also be time effective.

So for this week I used AI in some of my SQL assignments from a course. I was confused about a section of my query, so 
I decided to use claude for suggestions. I find claude to be extremely useful when it comes to uploading photos. chatgpt
in my experience does not provide a satisfying response even with all the photos submitted. chatgpt takes too long to process
photos, maybe its just me but with claude I get more. Another thing is that claude gives multiple suggestions for an answer.
I find this useful since it not vague and it remains simple. In the end I found what I was looking for. I think that using
AI has saved me time with problems like these. 

Week 4 (09/26/2025)

For this weeks AI use, I used for questions based on potatoes its random but not so random since its from a course I 
was a bit confused on certain areas. I didn't realize the extra details on potatoes, and using AI it helped me answer
some questions for an assignment. Overall, I have been using Claude daily more than googling. Its a lot more better
and useful. since most of the assignment was based on pictures I used it to provide me more background on the photos.
I think Claude does have flaws such as sometimes giving misleading information which is something I try to rectify.

For this week I used AI to summarize a reading for one of my classes. I just wanted some abstract based in the themes 
on the reading. What I learned was that giving it a proper prompt gives you a very good abstract of the whole reading. 
The reading was very long so what I did was ask it to summarize and to provide in text references. I found it to be very 
useful since I can upload a pdf with a lot of pages and since have a decent summary of everything. I think that one of the 
important things I found was that it was barely readable, most of the words were too specific which is fine but there was no
need to use those types of terms anyways. So what I did was to rewrite/regenerate the prompt by asking it reading questions.
I got a better response and more concise. It's a very useful feature and I see myself using this more often.

For this week, I used AI to identify a plant by taking a photo, uploading it, and waiting for the results. As always, 
I used Claude, but it was an incorrect move. I believe the Google Photos search feature was way better than what I got. I was 
looking for a certain plant, and I first gave it a choice based on what I thought from a list. So it took that for granted and
still made me believe that it was the same plant, but the TA said otherwise. I don't think it's its fault, since I was giving 
it misinformation. I think that other AI software is improving in quality, like Google.

For this week AI use I mostly used it for sql query writing. I did have an initial chat that I was going to share were I was forgot
my password to access the root of all my data in workbench. It would have been good to share it for this week use of AI, since I go back
and foward with the AI on so many errors and bugs. I clost the direct link for chat :(. I spent about one hour trying to reset my password,
but at the end Claude was just like - reset the whole database and create a new instance, which I ended up doing. I think it just gave up with 
the amount of error messages I was feeding it. At the end I gave up and started a new instance. I guess it wasn't that helpful since 
I was trying to reset my password not the whole instance, I would have done that myself. I lost all the data I had. It was frustrating because 
it would fix area of the command line prompt and not address the change for the rest. This serves as an example on how AI can sometimes just 
cannot solve stuff like these. Its better to just get community help from sites like stack overflow. It has nothing to really do with the linked chat, 
but its the aftermath of sloving this stupid hold up. 

Week 8 (11/09/25)

For this week, I had upcoming exams, and one way I found AI useful was through creating study guides. I was already given an outline of a study guide 
for the course, but I felt like I could make something even better. I think that it did a much better job expanding most of these topics. I have used 
ChatGPT for these types of situations, but what Claude does is create a whole new document that is much more fluent and easy to read/understand. 
Claude is more understanding on a human level about the importance of exams. It even started to give me tips on how to approach questions given on the exams.

Week 9 (11/14/25)

For this week, I used Claude to generate a map with different points and time periods. I found it interesting that most of what Claude generated was pretty bad, 
but it helped in creating the general concept of how to make one. I don't think it's very smart to just take whatever Claude or any AI machine information as final. 
The whole point is to integrate the information with your understanding alongside it. What I find very useful when I'm using Claude is uploading screenshots. 
I know GPT and others have this feature, but I find it more useful when using it with Claude

Week 10 (11/22/25)

For this week, I used ChatGPT for some Excel work. I decided to use it since I was having trouble getting data to display properly, so what I did was upload photos 
and prompts based on the assignments I had to do. What I found interesting about using the chat prompt was that ChatGPT would create a downloadable file in order for me 
to check the one that it created. I found this to be very useful since it allowed me to go back and check my work with AI being there to correct any type of errors I had. 
I think the most important thing about using AI this week was that it allowed me to view different solution options for my issue.

Week 11 (12/04/25)

For this week, I used Claude to help me imagine a good manufacturing location for semiconductors. This was part of a discussion post I needed to reply to. I have already 
tried to generate maps with Claude, but I think that ChatGPT is better at generating anything. I would not trust Claude with this task. I didn't generate anything with this chat; 
instead, I decided to find a map based on the area of Arizona. I always tend to give Claude more words relating to what I'm looking for out of a response. I think that using AI 
has been very useful, especially for these discussion posts since they're very tedious.

Today I used ChatGPT to help me extract key takeaways from my visit to the US Botanic Garden. I wanted to organize my thoughts and highlights from the trip in a clear, digestible format. 
The AI helped me structure the information and identify the most important points worth remembering from the experience. This was useful for both personal reflection and potentially sharing 
with others who might be interested in visiting.
