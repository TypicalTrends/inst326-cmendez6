For this weeks AI use, I used for questions based on potatoes its random but not so random since its from a course I 
was a bit confused on certain areas. I didn't realize the extra details on potatoes, and using AI it helped me answer
some questions for an assignment. Overall, I have been using Claude daily more than googling. Its a lot more better
and useful. since most of the assignment was based on pictures I used it to provide me more background on the photos.
I think Claude does have flaws such as sometimes giving misleading information which is something I try to rectify.
